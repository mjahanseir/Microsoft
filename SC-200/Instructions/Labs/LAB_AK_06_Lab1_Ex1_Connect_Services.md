# Learning Path 6 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Connect data to Microsoft Sentinel using data connectors

## Lab scenario

![Lab overview.](../Media/SC-200-Lab_Diagrams_Mod6_L1_Ex1.png)

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You must learn how to connect log data from the many data sources in your organization. The organization has data from Microsoft 365, Microsoft 365 Defender, Azure resources, non-azure virtual machines, etc. You start connecting the Microsoft sources first.

>**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/SC-200%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Connect%20data%20to%20Microsoft%20Sentinel%20using%20data%20connectors)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 


### Task 1: Access the Microsoft Sentinel Workspace

In this task, you will access your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

1. Log in to **WIN1** virtual machine as Admin with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.

The *Tenant-based Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Preview)* Data connector is used when a tenant has multiple subscriptions.

1. Select the *Subscription-based Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Legacy)* Data connector check-box, and select **Open connector page**.

1. In the *Configuration* section, under the *Instructions* tab, **select** the checkbox for the "Azure Pass - Sponsorship" subscription and slide the **Status** option to the right.

    >**Note:** If it switches back to disconnected, please review the Learning Path 3, Exercise 1, Task 1 to assign the proper permissions to your account.

1. The *Status* should be now **Connected** and "Bi-directional sync" should be *Enabled*.

    <!--- 1. Scroll down and under the *Create incidents - Recommended!* area, verify that *Create incidents automatically from all alerts generated in this connected service* is **Enabled**. --->
