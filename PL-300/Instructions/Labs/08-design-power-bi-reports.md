# Design Power BI reports

## Lab story

In this lab, you'll create a three-page report. You'll then publish it to the Power BI service, where you'll open and interact with the report.

In this lab, you learn how to:

- Design a report.
- Configure visual fields and format properties.
- Sync slicers.
- Publish the report to the Power BI service.
- Interact with a report and its visuals.

**This lab should take approximately 45 minutes.**

## Design page 1

In this task, you'll design the first report page. When you've completed the design, the page will look like the following:

![Screenshot of page 1, comprising a logo, two slicers, and three visuals.](Linked_image_Files/06-finished-report-page.png)

1. In Power BI Desktop, to rename the page, at the bottom-left, right-click **Page 1**, then select **Rename**. Rename the page as _Overview_.

    > _Tip: You can also double-click the page name to rename it._

1. To add an image, on the **Insert** ribbon tab, from inside the **Elements** group, select **Image**.

    ![Picture 1](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image15.png)

1. In the **Open** window, navigate to the **C:\Users\Student\Downloads\08-design-report** folder.

1. Select the **AdventureWorksLogo.jpg** file, and then select **Open**.

1. Drag the image to position it at the top-left corner, and also drag the guide markers to resize it.

    ![Picture 2](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image17.png)

1. To add a slicer, first de-select the image by selecting an empty area of the report page, then select **Slicer** in the **Visualizations** pane.

    ![Picture 3](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image18.png)

1. In the **Data** pane, drag the `Date | Year` field (not the `Year` level of the hierarchy) into the slicer **Field** well in the **Visualizations** pane.

    > _The labs use a shorthand notation to reference a field. It will look like this: `Date | Year`. In this example, `Date` is the table name and `Year` is the field name._

    ![Picture 17](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image16.png)

1. To convert the slicer from a list to a dropdown, in the **Visualizations** pane, select **Format visual**. Expand **Slicer settings**, and then set the **Style** dropdown to **Dropdown**.

    ![Picture 4](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_slicer_style.png)

1. Resize and position the slicer so it sits beneath the image and is the same width as the image.

    ![Picture 5](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image20.png)

1. In the **Year** slicer, open the dropdown list, select **FY2020**, and then collapse the dropdown list.

    > _The report page is now filtered by year **FY2020**._

    ![Picture 6](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image21.png)

1. De-select the slicer by selecting an empty area of the report page.

1. Create a second slicer, based on the `Region | Region` field (not the `Region` level of the hierarch).

1. Leave the slicer as a list, and then resize and position the slicer beneath the **Year** slicer.

    ![Picture 7](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image22.png)

1. De-select the slicer by selecting an empty area of the report page.

1. To add a chart to the page, in the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Line and Stacked Column Chart** visual type.

    ![Picture 8](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image26.png)

1. Resize and position the visual so it sits to the right of the logo, and so it fills the width of the report page.

    ![Picture 9](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image27.png)

1. Drag and drop the following fields into the visual:

     - `Date | Month`
     - `Sales | Sales`

1. In the visual fields pane (located in the **Visualizations** pane), notice that the fields are assigned to the **X-axis** and **Column y-axis** wells.

    > _By dragging fields into a visual, they're added to default wells. For precision, you can drag fields directly into the wells, as you'll do next._

    ![Picture 10](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image28_N.png)

1. From the **Data** pane, drag the `Sales | Profit Margin` field into the **Line y-axis** well.

    ![Picture 11](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image29.png)

1. Notice that the visual only has 11 months.

    > _The last month of the year, 2020 June, doesn't have any sales yet. By default, the visual has eliminated months with `BLANK` sales. You'll now configure the visual to show all months._

1. In the visual fields pane, in the **X-axis** well, for the **Month** field, select the down-arrow, and then select **Show items with no data**.

    ![Picture 12](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image30.png)

    > _Notice that the month **2020 June** now appears._

1. De-select the chart by selecting an empty area of the report page.

1. To add a chart to the page, in the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Stacked Column Chart** visual type.

    ![Picture 13](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_stacked-column-chart.png)

1. Resize and position the visual so it sits beneath the column/line chart, and so it fills half the width of the chart above.

    ![Picture 14](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image32.png)

1. Add the following fields to the visual wells:

     - X-axis: `Region | Group`
     - Y-axis: `Sales | Sales`
     - Legend: `Product | Category`

1. De-select the chart by selecting an empty area of the report page.

1. To add a chart to the page, in the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Stacked Bar Chart** visual type.

    ![Picture 15](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image33.png)

1. Resize and position the visual so it fills the remaining report page space.

    ![Picture 16](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image34.png)

1. Add the following fields to the visual wells:

     - Y-axis: `Product | Category`
     - X-axis: `Sales | Quantity`

1. To format the visual, open the **Format** pane.

    ![Picture 17](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image35.png)

1. Expand the **Bars** section, and then in the **Color** group, set the **Color** property to a suitable color (to complement the column/line chart).

1. Set the **Data Labels** section to **On**.

    ![Picture 18](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image36.png)

1. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

    > _The design of the first page is now complete._

## Design page 2

In this task, you'll design the second report page. When you've completed the design, the page will look like the following:

![Screenshot of page 2, comprising a slicer and matrix.](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image37.png)

> _**Important**: When detailed instructions have already been provided in the labs, the lab steps will provide more concise instructions. If you need the detailed instructions, you can refer back to other tasks in this lab._

1. To create a new page, at the bottom-left, select the plus icon. When the page is added, rename it as _Profit_.

1. Add a slicer based on the `Region | Region` field.

1. Use the **Format** pane to show the _Select all_ option (located in the **Slicer settings > Selection** section).

1. Resize and position the slicer so it sits at the left side of the report page, and so it's about half the page height.

    ![Picture 19](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image40.png)

1. Add a matrix visual, and resize and position it so it fills the remaining space of the report page

     - `Orders` (from the `Counts` folder)
     - `Sales`
     - `Cost`
     - `Profit` (from the `Pricing` folder)
     - `Profit Margin` (from the `Pricing` folder)

    ![Picture 22](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image43.png)

1. In the **Filters** pane (located at the left of the **Visualizations** pane), notice the **Filters on this page** section (you may need to expand open the pane and scroll down).

    ![Picture 23](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image44.png)

1. From the **Data** pane, drag the `Product | Category` field into the **Filters on this page** well.

    > _Fields added to the **Filters** pane can achieve the same result as a slicer. One difference is they don't take up space on the report page. Another difference is that they can be configured to achieve more sophisticated filtering requirements._

1. Inside the filter card, at the top right, select the arrow to collapse the card.

1. Add each of the following `Product` table fields to the **Filters on this page** well, collapsing each, directly beneath the `Category` field:

     - `Subcategory`
     - `Product`
     - `Color`

    ![Picture 24](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image46.png)

1. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

    > _The design of the second page is now complete._

![Screenshot of page 3, comprising a slicer and three visuals.](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image47.png)

1. Create a new page and rename it as _My Performance_.

1. To simulate the performance of row-level security filters, drag the `Salesperson (Performance) | Salesperson` field to the page level filters in the filter pane.

    ![Picture 25](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image999.png)

1. In the filter card, select **Michael Blythe**.

    > _Data on the report page will now be filtered to display data for Michael Blythe only._

1. Add a dropdown slicer based on the `Date | Year` field, and then resize and position it so it sits at the top-left corner of the page.

    ![Picture 26](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image49.png)

1. In the slicer, set the page to filter by **FY2019**.

    ![Picture 27](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image50.png)

1. Add a **Multi-row Card** visual to the page, and then resize and reposition it so it sits to the right of the slicer and fills the remaining width of the page.

    ![Picture 28](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image51.png)

    ![Picture 29](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image52.png)

1. Add the following four fields to the visual:

     - `Sales | Sales`
     - `Targets | Target`
     - `Targets | Variance`
     - `Targets | Variance Margin`

1. Format the visual:

     - In the **Callout values** section, increase the font size property to **28pt**.
     - In the **General** tab, in the **Effects** section, set the background color property to a light gray color (such as _White, 10% Darker_) to provide contrast.

        ![Picture 30](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image53.png)

1. Add a **Clustered Bar Chart** visual to the page, and then resize and position it so it sits beneath the multi-row card visual and fills the remaining height of the page, and half the width of the multi-row card visual.

    ![Picture 31](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image54.png)

    ![Picture 32](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image55.png)

1. Add the following fields to the visual wells:

     - Y-axis: `Date | Month`
     - X-axis: `Sales | Sales` and `Targets | Target`

        ![Picture 33](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image56.png)

1. To create a copy of the visual, press **Ctrl+C**, and then press **Ctrl+V**.

1. Position the new visual to the right of the original visual.

    ![Picture 34](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image57.png)

1. To modify the visualization type, in the **Visualizations** pane, select **Clustered Column Chart**.

    ![Picture 35](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_image58.png)

     > _It's now possible to see the same data expressed by two different visualization types. The design of the final page is complete._

## Sync slicers

In this task, you'll sync the _Year_ and _Region_ slicers.

1. On the _Overview_ page, set the _Year_ slicer to **FY2018**.

1. Go to the _My Performance_ page, and then notice that the _Year_ slicer has a different value.

    > _When slicers aren't synced, it can contribute to misrepresentation of data and frustration for report users. You'll now sync the report slicers._

1. Return to the _Overview_ page, and then select the _Year_ slicer.

1. On the **View** ribbon tab, from inside the **Show Panes** group, select **Sync Slicers**.

    ![Picture 36](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_e_image13.png)

1. In the **Sync Slicers** pane (at the left of the **Visualizations** pane), in the second column (which represents syncing), check the checkboxes for the _Overview_ and _My Performance_ pages.

    ![Picture 37](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_e_image14.png)

1. On the _Overview_ page, select the _Region_ slicer.

1. Sync the slicer with the _Overview_ and _Profit_ pages.

    ![Picture 38](Linked_image_Files/08-design-power-bi-reports_e_image15.png)
